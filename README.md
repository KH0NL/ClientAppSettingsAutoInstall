# ClientAppSettingsAutoInstall
I have created a python script that will automatically add the ClientSettings folder and ClientAppSettings.json file inside of the right \version folder.
It saves a bit of time and you don't have to manually readd the folder and file each time roblox updates.

-HOW TO USE:
Simply run the .py script or you can download the .exe version if you do not have python installed.
